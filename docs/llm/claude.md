in the claude project files, I have here with me some sample code to speed things up 
- lorton-monitor.ps1 
this is likely windows specific so don't know how much code we can take from here but the basic idea is we take network measurements every so often to be able to tell at a glance how the network is and see trendlines 
open-telemetry-hello-world shows how we can save open telemetry stuff into the file system. we should use xdg guidelines where possible and if the folder is not available, we should write to the same folder as we are in (with timestamps because we are nice) and if we can't even do that, we should keep going even without logging because the show must go on. 
the point of this application is a cross platform application that 
1. lets you know at a glance if your network is good 
1. lets you see trendlines in the past 
the seeing at a glace is higher priority than trendlines. 
we should save this otel stuff to both files and sqlite as well. 
as a guiding principle, we should stick to as few third party nuget packages as possible 
as a non-negotiable strict rule, we MUST NEVER EVER use nuget packages that are non-free. 
ban packages with a vengeance even if they allow "non commercial" or "open source" applications 
for example, fluent assertions, mass transit and so on are completely banned 
nuget packages by controversial people should also be banned 
for example, moq is banned from this repository. 
prefer fewer dependencies and more code written by us 
prefer long term stable code over flashy dependencies 
the code should be cross platform -- windows, macOS, and Linux 
as such it should be possible to run -- and stop -- the application within automated test environments such as github actions. 
generate a shell script that will then write the complete application in one shot. 
assume the shell script will run on a standard fedora linux workstation. 
current folder information is available on `output.txt` 
current folder contents is available in `dump.txt` 
dump.txt is generated with `export.sh` and will be kept up to date.
